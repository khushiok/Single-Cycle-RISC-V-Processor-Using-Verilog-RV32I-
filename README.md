#  Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor (RV32I) in Verilog

##  Overview  
This project presents the design and implementation of a **Single-Cycle RISC-V (RV32I) processor** using Verilog. The processor executes each instruction within a single clock cycle, making it simple yet effective for understanding fundamental computer architecture concepts. The design integrates essential modules such as the Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Register File, Immediate Generator, ALU, Control Unit, Data Memory, and multiplexers. It supports **R-type, I-type, S-type, and B-type instructions**, performing arithmetic, logical, memory, and branch operations. While single-cycle processors are less efficient for complex tasks, they provide a strong foundation for exploring datapath design, control signal generation, and instruction execution flow.
