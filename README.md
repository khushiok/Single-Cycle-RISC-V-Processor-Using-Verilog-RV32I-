# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor-Using-Verilog-RV32I-
This project implements a Single-Cycle RISC-V (RV32I) processor in Verilog, integrating modules like ALU, control unit, register file, instruction/data memory, and multiplexers. It executes R, I, S, and B-type instructions in one clock cycle, providing a foundation for learning computer architecture and processor design.
